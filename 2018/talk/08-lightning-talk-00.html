        This presentation covers research-in-progress results of an assessment of the IT security awareness of five exemplary German-language emergency-alert applications. Applications of this kind became part of many modular-oriented warning systems around the globe. Warning and intended population behavior relies on trust upon the integrity of any warning institution, be it governmental or private. IT security is crucial in order not to undermine trust. Emergency apps do not fit into the typical entertainment purpose of mobile applications, and we show that their primarily focus on keeping the user safe from harm can cause a conflict of interest about distribution of scarce technical resources on a mobile device, which may again endanger IT security of the end user. We therefore promote a better integration and standardization of disaster management functionality within mobile emergency-alert applications, as well as recommendations for the development process. The above is motivated by presenting application-level weaknesses of frequently used emergency-alert applications from the DACH area for the Android operating system.
