    <p>In this training you can test your skills in hacking modern web applications against the <a href="http://owasp-juice.shop" target="_blank">OWASP Juice Shop</a>!
        There are dozens of challenges that are waiting to be solved, ranging from simple functional problems and the usual XSS/SQLi issues over severe authentication
        flaws up to multi-step and multi-path attacks!</p>

    <p>The training will consist of multiple short teasers to specific vulnerabilities and lots of time for hacking! You can then stick to the covered topic or go into free-roaming
        mode and just try to beat as many challenges as possible. Your pace is entirely up to you! Some of the more mindboggling challenges will be tackled in a swarm-hacking
        style together on the big screen. Over the entire duration of the training you can get first-hand hints in case you get stuck on any challenge.</p>
