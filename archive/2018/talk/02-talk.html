        Even though modern mobile operating systems like iOS and Android offer great APIs for secure data storage and communication, those APIs have to be used correctly in order to be effective. Data storage, inter-app communication, proper usage of cryptographic APIs and secure network communication are only some of the aspects that require careful consideration. The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for testing the security of mobile apps. It describes processes and techniques for verifying the requirements listed in the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) and provides a baseline for complete and consistent security tests.

        In this talk, the MASVS and the MSTG will be shortly introduced and we will go through the Mobile Security Testing path, from Vulnerability Analysis to Penetration Testing. We will highlight how the MASVS and MSTG can support anyone who starts on this field, but also someone more experienced, by giving a testing standard and methodology that is easy and clear to understand as well as entertaining to read and work with. The talk will be supported with short examples and conclude with a full live demo based on dynamic instrumentation.

        Carlos Holguera is a security engineer working at ESCRYPT GmbH since 2012 and currently leading the security testing lab in Berlin. His areas of expertise include automotive and mobile security testing, where he found two of his biggest passions: reverse engineering and dynamic instrumentation. Shortly after starting his collaboration on the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Project, he attended the OWASP Security Summit where he got to know its project leaders Sven Schleier and Bernhard Mueller. They worked together to make the first release of the MSTG possible.
