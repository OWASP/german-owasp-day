        In the last year a lot has happened, so it is time for the traditional/inevitable OWASP Juice Shop update of 2018:
        <ul>
            <li>Two students and three mentors did amazing work during the Google Summer of Code, which will culminate in the v8.0.0 release some time this year</li>
            <li>The AngularJS frontend is currently being completely rewritten into the latest Angular with Material Design and all kinds of extra fanciness</li>
            <li>Over 20 new challenges have been added over the last year, including JWT issues, XXE, RCE, more Injection, more XSS, more of probably even worse stuff</li>
            <li>The official CTF setup-utility now supports not only CTFd but Facebook's FBCTF framework</li>
            <li>The Juice Shop is seeing more usage world-wide than ever before with a total of over 250.000 pulls of its Docker image and hundreds of clone operations of its GitHub repository per week</li>
        </ul>
        A lot more might still happen in the time between the submission of this abstract and the actual German OWASP Day. It might even have its own "commercial" jingle or song by then...
