In this talk, we will discuss transient execution attacks: Meltdown and Spectre. After understanding the key idea behind
Meltdown and Spectre we will learn about more recent variants and discuss fundamental differences between Meltdown and
Spectre. Afterwards we will discuss the various countermeasures against transient execution attacks. We will see that
there is still a lot of work to be done until transient execution attacks are sufficiently mitigated.
