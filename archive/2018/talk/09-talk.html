In this talk, we will discuss transient execution attacks: Meltdown and Spectre. After understanding the key idea behind
Meltdown and Spectre we will learn about more recent variants and discuss fundamental differences between Meltdown and
Spectre. Afterwards we will discuss the various countermeasures against transient execution attacks. We will see that
there is still a lot of work to be done until transient execution attacks are sufficiently mitigated.

       Daniel Gruss (@lavados) is an Assistant Professor at Graz University of
Technology. He finished his PhD with distinction in less than 3 years.
He has been involved in teaching operating system undergraduate courses
since 2010. Daniel's research focuses on software-based side-channel
attacks that exploit timing differences in hardware and operating
systems. He implemented the first remote fault attack running in a
website, known as Rowhammer.js. He frequently speaks at top
international venues, such as Black Hat, Usenix Security, IEEE S&amp;P, ACM
CCS, Chaos Communication Congress, and others. His research team was one
of the four teams that found the Meltdown and Spectre bugs published in
early 2018.
