        Third-party libraries on Android have been shown to be security and privacy hazards by adding security vulnerabilities to their host apps or by misusing inherited access rights. Correctly attributing improper app behavior either to app or library developer code or isolating library code from their host apps would be highly desirable to mitigate these problems, but is impeded by the absence of a third-party library detection that is effective and reliable in spite of obfuscated code.

        In this talk, I'll highlight a library detection technique that is resilient against common code obfuscations and that is capable of pinpointing the exact library version used in apps. Applying this approach to apps from Google Play, we measure the outdatedness of libraries and particularly show that app developers slowly adapt new library versions, exposing their end-users to large windows of vulnerability. We discover that long-known security vulnerabilities in popular libraries are still present in current apps. A subsequent analysis of the apps' library usage reveals that 97.8% of apps that actively use a library with a known vulnerability could be easily fixed through a drop-in replacement of the vulnerable version with the fixed version. I conclude with a discussion of root causes of the current status-quo and by proposing actionable items to remedy the situation.    </p>
