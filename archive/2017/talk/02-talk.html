        All know the OWASP TopTen, some one or more other projects. The problem is, where the wiki is good to archive the project information, it is hard to find information if you don't know what you are looking for. Therefore, only a few have a broader understanding of projects (being tools or guides) you can use in your software development lifecycle, even before, to create more secure software. This talk is highlighting various OWASP projects taking you from CISO policies, security requirements to building and secure software and verifying the security level.
