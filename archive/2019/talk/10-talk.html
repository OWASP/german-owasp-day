    <p>You didn't think you'd get away with a German OWASP Day lacking the annual Juice Shop update? We released a new major version and it is probably our most feature-rich and beautiful release to date:
<ul>
<li>Facelift of UI towards Material Design standards and UX best practices</li>
<li>Extended realism during checkout with delivery addresses and payment options</li>
<li>Hacking Instructor providing tutorial scripts for newbie hackers</li>
<li>New RBAC model to distinguish admin, accountant, deluxe and normal users</li>
<li>Refactored challenge names, descriptions, hints and categories</li>
</ul>
You will also get an almost brag-free update on the projects usage stats - such as our unbelievable >3.8M Docker image pulls. All this (and probably more) gets freshly pressed into this 15min juice-talk!
