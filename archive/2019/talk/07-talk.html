        To allow for fluid, full-featured web applications, a typical web browser’s JavaScript engine nowadays employs countless optimizations and commonly features multiple levels of just-in-time compilers to boost performance even further. Given such complexity, it is no surprise that implementation mistakes occur on a regular basis. As these defects are often exploitable, JavaScript engines have by now become a favored target for attackers, with many browser attacks now targeting a JavaScript engine as part of the exploit chain. This talk attempts to explain the reasons behind some of the complexity and in particular how various design decisions of the JavaScript language lead to tricky optimizations, exploitable programming mistakes, and compromised web browsers.
