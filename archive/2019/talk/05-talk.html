        We took a look into Neato and Vorwerk vacuum cleaning robots. This talk is about their whole ecosystem, including security of the robots themselves, as well as the cloud infrastructure. Our key findings were key findings---we exfiltrated encryption keys from various robot components, that enabled us to talk to the cloud. Before fixes in the cloud were rolled out, flaws in the ecosystem allowed attackers to take over arbitrary robots without prior authentication.
