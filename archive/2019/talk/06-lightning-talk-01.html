        In the talk, we will present a new open-source web app called canitrust. It is meant to be a security-focused counterpart to caniuse.com. The app is work in progress and has been deployed to canitrust.in in May 2019. Users are free to crawl interesting corner cases concerning the browsers' interpretation of directives, policies and content served by web apps. They can study conflicting HSTS or CSP directives, the actual interpretation of caching headers, and the impact of the X-XSS-Protection header in several scenarios. Volunteers are welcome to join the development and test-case generation. The audience of the talk will be challenged to guess the outcome of some test setups. Also, they will learn our lessons learned from the development of canitrust and a basic introduction into the architecture.
