        Threat modelling is a software analysis technique capable of finding design defects. But what sort of issues are uncovered in practice using threat modelling? This talk bridges the gap between theory and practice by describing case studies – design flaws uncovered for actual (but anonymised) systems across many domains, for example online gaming, two-factor authentication, business-to-business, embedded, and cloud. In this talk we are less concerned with theory. Instead, in this session the attendee will gain insight into the mindset of threat modelling by considering mistakes in the real-world. Along the way we will (re)learn secure design principles and attack patterns and see how the theory is expressed in reality.
