        Many Internet of Things devices are made for monitoring what matters most to us—our aparments, children and pets. We test security and privacy of several IoT cameras. First, we do a lot of penetration testing without following any guidelines and without using automated tools. These tests are tailored to each device’s technologies and outcomes are quite individual. Second, we do structured testing by following existing penetration testing guides. We compare the applicability, performance and quality of penetration testing guides with respect to finding vulnerabilities on devices in the wild.
