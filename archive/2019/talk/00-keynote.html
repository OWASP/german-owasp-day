Today, the vast majority of applications are vulnerable to code injection attacks. In this talk we will explore techniques that have proven successful to eliminate certain types of code injection attacks within the Firefox codebase. Ultimately, there is no silver bullet that can eliminate all vulnerabilities in applications, but we will examine how using a layered defense strategy allows us to harden the Content Security Landscape of Firefox against injection attacks.
