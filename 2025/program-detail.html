                          <p>Generative AI is supposed to make our lives easier. But what if it's really just coding us straight into a new Dark Age? We hand over our systems to AI agents, only to watch them invent backdoors nobody asked for. Developers are left with the glamorous job of bug janitors, while attackers get new exploits. It's hard not to feel like we are front-row spectators to the collapse of digital civilization. This talk shows how these risks are multiplying, and how the public debate around security often misses the point, making it even harder to fix what is broken. Maybe what we are really witnessing is the world's biggest live demo of the digital apocalypse. But sometimes you have to watch everything burn down before you can rebuild it better.</p>

                          <p>With the increasing reliance on third-party software components, ensuring their security against known vulnerabilities has become a daily challenge for individuals and organizations. Despite the availability of a variety of tools and databases, we found all of them fall
                            short when applied to real-world scenarios - raising questions about their effectiveness, generalizability, and practical utility.</p>
                          <p>Starting from our perspective as penetration testers, we identified three main problems with existing solutions in vulnerability identification:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Accuracy and completeness of results - Many tools exhibit limited precision and recall, often depending on a single data source (e.g. NVD) and overlooking critical indicators such as known exploits or patch history.</li>
                            <li>Rigid input requirements - Most solutions enforce strict formatting constraints (e.g., requiring exact CPEs), creating usability and reliability issues when dealing with diverse or incomplete data.</li>
                            <li>Lack of usable outputs - The inability to meaningfully export or integrate results into broader workflows hampers both manual and automated security processes.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>In order to solve these challenges, we developed the open-source tool search_vulns. It leverages information from multiple data sources and uses text comparison techniques and CPEs in combination to increase accuracy in software identification. Due to this approach, it can even automatically generate CPEs that have yet to be published. Together with its custom logic for version comparison, this further enhances the quality of results. Finally, search_vulns provides a fine-granular export of results in different formats.</p>
                          <p>In conclusion, this talk aims to simplify the surprising complexity of finding known vulnerabilities in software. To do so, we discuss common challenges in mapping software names to CPEs, e.g. for product rebrandings, single-version vulnerabilities and yet to be published software versions. In addition, we present an approach using multiple data  sources in combination to enrich CVE data with information on known exploits, likelihood of exploitability (EPSS) and other data sources. Finally, we present search_vulns as open-source tool.</p>

                          <p>PDFs are considered static and trustworthy - but in fact, they are far more dynamic than most users realize. With XML Forms Architecture (XFA), Adobe introduced a powerful extension back in 1999 that is used in millions of forms worldwide.</p>
                          <p>It allows dynamic layouts, scripts, network communication, and even file access - opening up a huge, previously unexplored attack surface. In addition, PDFs support JavaScript functions and actions that can dynamically change the contents of PDFs. This enables various attacks on digital signatures. The presentation for German OWASP Day is divided into two main parts.</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li> In the first part of the presentation, we show how PDFs can be cleverly used for attacks that allow content to be reloaded, files to be read, or applications to be crashed in a targeted manner. For this, we use XML Forms Architecture (XFA), a powerful PDF feature that has received little attention in the security community to date. Using concrete examples and with the help of our XFA scanner tool, we will show that almost all PDF viewers examined are vulnerable in at least one category (RCE, file inclusion, URL invocation, DoS).</li>
                            <li>The second part of the presentation focuses on attacks on digital signatures in PDFs. To do this, we use the concept of dynamic content in PDFs. We demonstrate how the PDF and XFA specifications can be used to manipulate content in signed documents after or even immediately before the signature is created. Surprisingly, this works both with and without JavaScript. We present various categories of attacks, show the role of actions and embedded code, and explain the countermeasures taken by PDF software manufacturers. The presentation thus provides a better understanding of the hidden dangers of dynamic PDF functions and offers ideas on how to deal with legacy issues in security-critical applications.</li>

                          <p> Security teams often inherit their organisation's structure - for better or worse. The way you design your AppSec programme and choose your team topology can determine whether security becomes a trusted enabler or a frustrating bottleneck.</p>
                          <p>In this story-driven session, we follow Alex, who begins as the only security person in a 50-person startup. At first, Alex builds a centralised AppSec team, finding it effective for control but slow to scale. As the company grows to hundreds of employees, bottlenecks appear, and burnout looms. Alex experiments with embedded security engineers, Security as a Platform, and a Security Champions network, learning the trade-offs of each approach along the way.</p>

                          <p>Companies within the European Union are increasingly required to be able to issue and process electronic invoices according to EU standards. For example, since January 2025, companies in Germany have been required to support electronic invoices in B2B contexts.</p>
                          <p>While it is desirable to standardize invoice data formats, the EU standards have severe problems. They are overly and needlessly complicated, and security was not given much consideration. An unfortunate design choice to use a problematic "standard" (XSLT 2/3) only supported by a single implementation with inherent security problems makes security vulnerabilities in electronic invoicing software even more likely.</p>
                          <p>The EU standard allows multiple redundant XML data formats to encode electronic invoices. XML processing has several well-known, inherent security problems, most notably file exfiltration via XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.</p>
                          <p>It appears that XML security was not considered during the creation of these standards. Neither the standardization documents nor the information found on various government and EU web pages contain any information about avoiding XML security flaws.</p>
                          <p>Therefore, unsurprisingly, security vulnerabilities in software processing these electronic invoices are very common.</p>

                          <p>Die von LangSec beschrieben grundlegenden Sicherheitsprinzipien erklären die Hauptursachen vieler Sicherheitslücken und wie man diese beheben kann. LangSec sieht die anhaltende Schwachstellen-Epidemie in Software als eine Folge der ad-hock Entwicklung von Code, der Ein- und Ausgaben verarbeitet. Gemäß LangSec besteht der Schlüssel zur Entwicklung vertrauenswürdiger Software, die mit potenziell bösartigen Eingaben korrekt umgeht, darin alle gültigen oder erwarteten Eingaben und Ausgaben als formale Sprache zu behandeln. Dementsprechend müssen die Routinen zur Verarbeitung von Eingaben und Ausgaben als Parser beziehungsweise Unparser für diese Sprache behandelt werden und auch dementsprechend entwickelt werden. In diesem Vortrag möchte ich LangSec und die Implikationen für unsere tägliche Arbeit in AppSec vorstellen ohne in die Tiefen der Theoretischen Informatik und des Compilerbaus abzudriften.</p>

                          <p>Web application firewalls are often seen as a hindrance when going live, as perimeter WAFs can clash with GitOps-driven platforms. Empowering development teams with an application-centric WAF setup allows them to run and tune the WAF throughout the entire development lifecycle. It also enables full integration into any CI/CD pipeline or GitOps approach, reducing late surprises during deployment.</p>
                          <p>In this talk, we demonstrate the application-centric approach with Envoy Proxy, OWASP Coraza, and the OWASP Core Rule Set (components are examples and interchangeable; focus is on principles and selection criteria), and take you along our real-world journey - highlighting the challenges and lessons learned. What you'll take away: We show where this reusable reference design reduces friction and where it backfires, and we outline the governance and guardrails needed to make it work in practice.</p>

                          <p>Mit WebAuthn sollte das Passwort im Web abgelöst werden: einheitliche, sichere, handhabbare Authentifizierung für alle! Großes Alleinstellungsmerkmal sollte die Unmöglichkeit von Phishing-Angriffen sein. Mit der Weiterentwicklung in Form von Passkeys wurden einige Usability-Verbesserungen vorgenommen, um die breite Adaption zu ermöglichen. Dabei wurden einige Sicherheitsprinzipien von WebAuthn aufgeweicht.</p>

Außerdem demonstrieren wir eine praktische Möglichkeit in begrenztem Rahmen für solche Angriffe und diskutieren Gegenmaßnahmen.</p>
                          <p>Die Teilnehmenden lernen, welche Sicherheitsprinzipien von WebAuthn für Passkeys weiterhin gelten, und welche nicht. Sie erfahren, wieso Passkeys nicht mehr komplett phishing-proof sind und wie sie diese Abwägung für den eigenen Einsatz von Passkeys bewerten können.</p>

                          <p>Threat modeling stands at a critical juncture. While essential for creating secure systems, it remains mostly manual, handcrafted, and often too slow for today's development cycles. At the same time, automation and AI offer new levels of speed and scalability— but how much can we rely on them?</p>
                          <p>This talk explores the tension between automation and human expertise in threat modeling. We'll dissect the traditional threat modeling process—scoping, modeling, threat identification, risk analysis, and mitigation—and perform a step-by-step gap analysis to identify what can realistically be automated today, what cannot, and why.</p>
                          <p>We'll dive into:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Current tooling: Review the AI threat modeling tools that handle diagram-based automation, template-driven modeling, risk scoring, and pattern matching.</li>
                            <li>Emerging AI use cases: automatically generating threat models from architecture diagrams, user stories, or use case descriptions; providing AI-assisted mitigation suggestions; and conducting NLP-driven threat analysis.</li>
                            <li>Limitations and risks: False confidence, hallucinations, model bias, ethical accountability, and the challenge of modeling new or context-specific threats.</li>                  
                          </ul>
                          <p>We will ground this analysis with examples from organizations and academic research that aim to scale threat modeling without compromising depth or quality, drawing parallels to how other activities, such as SAST and DAST scanning, evolved.</p>
                          <p>Attendees will walk away with a practical roadmap for integrating automation without undermining the human insight threat modeling still requires.</p>
                          <p>This talk isn't a tool pitch. It's a candid, experience-based view of where automation can meaningfully accelerate threat modeling—and where the human must remain firmly in the loop.</p>

                          <p>Do you always read the documentation before using a function in your languages' standard library? This talk explores the attack surface of a special feature in PHP which is easy to misuse with unforseen consequences. The `extract` function allows to replace the value of local variables named after the keys in an array. Calling it with user-controlled input allows the attacker to change arbitrary variables in the program. The documentation warns against the dangers of using it with untrusted data, but our large-scale analysis on 28.325 PHP projects from GitHub shows, that this warning is ignored.</p>
                          <p>The talk walks through the process of identifing `extract`-based vulnerabilities and how they might have ended up the way they are by looking at the surrounding code. After introducing different levels of attacker-control guided by concrete exploits, listeners gain an intuition on what to look out for while reviewing code.</p>

                          <p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the latest hot topic in cybersecurity. Business wants it (AI is the new mantra), developers are excited (new toys, new code), and security teams are left to make it safe—often with already packed schedules. Let's treat it like just another Tuesday. Like many shiny new technologies (remember the early days of cloud?), MCP is being built with a “features first, security later” mindset. As a fresh piece of tech, it blends novel vulnerabilities with familiar, well-known ones. If you're an early adopter, it's important to accept that MCP and its current implementations are imperfect—and to be ready for that. In this talk, we'll dive into the real-world challenges companies are facing with MCP and equip you with practical remediations.</p>
                          <p> We'll cover topics such as:

                          <p>Browser extensions are a powerful part of the Web ecosystem as they extend browser functionality and let users personalize their online experience. But with higher privileges than regular web apps, extensions bring unique security and privacy risks. Much like web applications, vulnerabilities often creep in, not just through poor implementation, but also through gaps in developer awareness and ecosystem support.</p>
                          <p>In this talk, we share insights from a recent study in which we interviewed and observed 21 extension developers across the world [1] as they worked on security and privacy-related tasks that we designed based on our prior works and observations [2, 3]. Their live decision-making revealed common misconceptions, unexpected pain points, and ecosystemic obstacles in the extension development lifecycle. Extending beyond our published results, we plan to highlight some of the untold anecdotes, insecure development practices, their threat perception, the design-level challenges, as well as the misconceptions around them.</p>
                          <p>The audience will take away the following items from the presentation/discussion:

                          <p>As a CISO (or any other security expert) in the area of AI, you can find yourself in increasingly challenging and sometimes bizarre AI-related situations not unlike Alice's adventures in Wonderland.</p>
                          <p>Depending on whom you speak to, people either have high (inflated?) expectations about the (magic?) benefits of AI for security efforts, or try to explain why "AI security Armageddon" is looming... and that is just the security part of the story. All other areas in your organization are heavily using or experimenting with AI (e.g., vibe coding, automation, decision making, etc.), challenging (or ignoring) established security practices.</p>
                          <p>This talk tells the story of the daily experience of dealing with AI as a CISO in a cloud-application startup. Which experiments failed or were successful, which advice is helpful, what is difficult to apply in practice, which questions are still open...</p>
                          <p>The motivation for this talk is to start a conversation among security experts on how we can shape a secure AI future and not get pushed into the role of being seen as "hindering" AI progress.</p>

                          <p>Dieser Vortrag analysiert die Vor- und Nachteile von Coding Assistants in Hinblick auf die Sicherheit des entstehenden Codes. Er gibt einen Überblick über die aktuelle Studienlage und die Benchmarks zu den verschiedenen Modellen und diskutiert die Ergebnisse. Neben der Bedeutung von eingebrachten Schwachstellen im Code selbst werden Risiken wie Slopsquatting, Model Poisoning und Rules File Backdoors erläutert. Zuletzt gibt der Vortrag Empfehlungen zu Best Practices für die Nutzung von Coding Assistants: von der richtigen Konfiguration und Nutzung über Richtlinien zum Review und Testen von solchem Code.</p>

                          <p>Der Cyber Resilience Act, kurz CRA, ist eine neue Verordnung der EU und tritt im Dezember 2027 vollständig in Kraft. Das Kernelement der Verordnung ist die Softwaresicherheit für alle so genannten „Produkte mit digitalen Elementen“, die auf dem EU-Markt kommerziell angeboten werden. Diese umfassen sowohl vernetzte Hardware-Produkte, in denen Firmwares laufen, als auch reine Softwareprodukte. Die Anforderungen an die Software-Hersteller erstrecken sich von grundsätzlichem „Security by Design“ und „Secure by Default“, über Bedrohungsanalysen der Software bis hin zu verpflichtendem Patching und Schwachstellenmanagement.</p>
                          <p>Die Themen klingen irgendwie familiär? Kein Wunder, denn eine ganze Reihe von Projekten aus dem OWASP-Ökosystem sind geradezu prädestiniert zum Einsatz im Kontext des CRAs. Nicht nur, dass mit CycloneDX einer der zwei de-facto SBOM-Standards aus OWASP heraus entstanden ist - auch Frameworks wie OWASP SAMM oder Tools wie Dependency-Track können ganz entscheidende Rollen für die Umsetzung von Supply-Chain-Security und SDLC-Prozessen spielen.</p>
                          <p>In diesem Talk schauen wir uns die Anforderungen der Verordnung genauer an und blicken dann auf Schnittstellen zu OWASP-Projekten. Dies soll am Ende helfen, sowohl für die Seite der Hersteller ein besseres Bild für OWASP zu erzeugen, als auch von OWASP-Seite aus zielgenauer auf CRA-Verpflichtete zugehen zu können. Je mehr Menschen sich in den Themen wiederfinden und Zusammenarbeit entstehen kann, desto besser.</p>

                          <p>Web application scanners are popular and effective black-box testing tools, automating the detection of vulnerabilities by exploring and interacting with user interfaces. Despite their effectiveness, these scanners struggle with discovering deeper states in modern web applications due to their limited understanding of workflows. This study addresses this limitation by introducing YuraScanner, a task-driven web application scanner that leverages large-language models (LLMs) to autonomously execute tasks and workflows.</p>
                          <p>YuraScanner operates as a goal-based agent, suggesting actions to achieve predefined objectives by processing webpages to extract semantic information. Unlike traditional methods that rely on user-provided traces, YuraScanner uses LLMs to bridge the semantic gap, making it web application-agnostic. Using the XSS engine of Black Widow, YuraScanner tests discovered input points for vulnerabilities, enhancing the scanning process's comprehensiveness and accuracy.</p>
                          <p>We evaluated YuraScanner on 20 diverse web applications, focusing on task extraction, execution accuracy, and vulnerability detection. The results demonstrate YuraScanner's superiority in discovering new attack surfaces and deeper states, significantly improving vulnerability detection. Notably, YuraScanner identified 12 unique zero-day XSS vulnerabilities, compared to three by Black Widow. This study highlights YuraScanner's potential to revolutionize web application scanning with its automated, task-driven approach.</p>
