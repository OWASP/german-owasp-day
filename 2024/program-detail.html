                          <p>OWASP Juice Shop is - even after 10 years - still probably the most modern and sophisticated
                            insecure web application. It encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with
                            many other security flaws, packaged in a realistic and fully functional web shop. We will offer the
                            following sessions about Juice Shop in a half-day training:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Juice Shop Introduction: In the brief session, you will learn all the basics of the OWASP Juice
                              Shop project: Why it exists, what it can do, where you can get it from, and how to get it running!
                              This session will make sure that newcomers and experts alike can enjoy and follow in the
                              subsequent Juice Shop sessions! </li>
                            <li>Shake Logger XSS Demo: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) demonstrations in secure coding training often
                              rely on simple alert boxes, which can understate the true risks of this vulnerability. This
                              session will show you how to effectively illustrate the damage potential of XSS to both developers
                              and non-technical audiences, providing a more realistic and compelling demonstration of its
                              impact.</li>
                            <li>Multi Juicer Introduction: Running CTFs and security trainings with OWASP Juice Shop is usually
                              quite tricky, as Juice Shop isn't intended to be used by multiple users at the same time.
                              MultiJuicer is a Juice Shop sub-project designed to make running trainings and CTFs with Juice
                              Shop as easy and effective as possible. This session introduces the project and provides tips and
                              tricks for setting it up in various cloud or on-prem environments.</li>
                            <li>Just-for-fun CTF w/ MultiJuicer: In this session, we will use MultiJuicer to host a short CTF on
                              a live MultiJuicer environment to demonstrate how it can be used for trainings and CTFs. This will
                              be a hands-on session, so be sure to bring your laptops!</li>

                          <p>In case your organization plans to increase the collaboration between engineering and security
                            functions, a Security Champions Program can be the perfect solution to achieve that. The program
                            involves engineers in security topics that are relevant to their work and thereby strengthens their
                            awareness for security in the organization. Yet, building it up requires concepts which spark the
                            interest and motivation with people in security.</p>
                          <p>The goal of the training is to give your hands-on experience and concepts how to get your program
                            established. It will look into personality types and how to best get them incorporated, give you a
                            structure at hand that can be used as a template to get started in a structured and documentable
                            way, and it will outline on the phases and considerations to start scaling your program over time.
                            Whether you are security engineer, architect or a security manager the training will give you the
                            toolset to build the program in coalition with your engineers.</p>
                          <p>The training will be highly interactive with the audience being assembled in smaller teams for
                            individual practices, interaction with other interested people in the field is thereby guaranteed.
                          </p>
                          <p>The training will assemble in the following blocks:</p>

                          <p>In today's digital world, building secure software is more critical than ever. However,
                            implementing software assurance can be a complex and daunting task, particularly without a good
                            framework. That's where OWASP SAMM comes in - it provides a structural and measurable framework to
                            formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of
                            your organization.</p>
                          <p> This half-day training (in English), consisting of a mix of presentations and interactive
                            workshops, aims to provide participants with a more in-depth understanding and practical experience
                            with the OWASP SAMM model. The training is divided into four parts:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Part One provides an overview of the model, including the five Business Functions of Governance,
                              Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operations, and discusses the various constituent
                              elements, such as metrics. This part also explains the overall usage scenarios of the model.</li>
                            <li>Part Two is a hands-on workshop that involves an actual SAMM evaluation of your organization (or
                              one that you have worked for). Participants will go through an evaluation of all the SAMM domains
                              and discuss the results in the group. This part aims to provide participants with a good
                              indication of their organization's maturity in software assurance, and identify the most important
                              challenges in getting to their target model.</li>
                            <li>Part Three covers the OWASP SAMM tools, including the Assessment Toolkit, Benchmark Project, and
                              relationships with other SAMM projects and tools.</li>
                            <li>Part Four concludes the training by discussing OWASP SAMM best practices, including choosing the
                              right starting points, monitoring and metrics, achieving security by default, and critical success
                              factors.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>If you haven't started a secure software initiative in your organization yet, this training will
                            provide you with the necessary foundations and ideas to do so. The training concludes with a group
                            discussion, where participants can share experiences and address specific questions or challenges
                            they are facing regarding secure development in their organizations.</p>

                            applications to train their web hacking skills. In 2014 the Juice Shop entered the stage as one of
                            the first Rich Internet Application representatives.
                            What started as a personal pet project with two dozen hacking challenges, became an OWASP Flagship
                            project shortly after and grew in size, scope and use case coverage significantly over the years.

                          <p>OAuth 2.0 has become the backbone of secure delegated authorization on the web, enabling users to grant third-party applications access to their data without revealing their credentials. It's also foundational for federated authentication via OpenID Connect and plays a critical role in emerging technologies like wallet ecosystems. However, despite its wide adoption, OAuth implementations are fraught with risks — many of which can lead to serious security breaches.</p>
                          <p>The challenges arise from OAuth's use in contexts far more dynamic and high-stakes than what was originally envisioned. Today, OAuth protects sensitive financial APIs, powers identity verification systems, and secures modern app ecosystems — yet, many implementations remain vulnerable to attack. Even with the guidance from RFC6749 and RFC6819, subtle misconfigurations and outdated practices are still common, often due to the complexities of real-world deployments.</p>
                          <p>To address these evolving security needs, the IETF is finalizing the OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice (BCP), an updated set of recommendations designed to mitigate common vulnerabilities and improve OAuth implementations across industries. This new RFC introduces stronger security measures and deprecates insecure approaches like the Implicit Grant, while also tackling new threats such as the Authorization Server Mix-Up Attack.</p>
                          <p>In this talk, we will dive into the core challenges of securing OAuth in today's dynamic and high-stakes environments. Attendees will learn about the most critical updates from the Security BCP, including the MUSTs, MUST NOTs, and SHOULDs that are essential for robust OAuth implementations.</p>

                          <p>In the coming years, all EU member states will be required to provide their citizens with a digital identity wallet, as mandated by the European Union. The EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) represents the largest implementation of its kind to date and brings with it significant challenges, particularly in terms of security, privacy, and interoperability. To address these challenges, the EU has chosen to leverage open standards widely adopted in the web ecosystem — such as OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP) based the widely-used web standard OAuth 2.0, and Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) built on the JSON Web Token (JWT) framework.</p>
                          <p>However, wallet ecosystems operate quite differently from the traditional web, requiring adaptations to these protocols to meet the unique demands of secure, decentralized identity management. This talk will provide a comprehensive overview of the EUDI Wallet's architecture and the key challenges posed by adapting native web protocols for wallet ecosystems. It will also explore the crucial role browser vendors will play in ensuring the security and smooth functioning of this new digital identity landscape.

                          <p>Die NIS2-Richtlinie (Network and Information Security Directive) der Europäischen Union stellt eine Weiterentwicklung der bestehenden Cybersicherheitsanforderungen dar und zielt darauf ab, die Resilienz und Sicherheit kritischer Infrastrukturen in der EU zu stärken. In Deutschland liegt derzeit mit dem NIS2UmsuCG (NIS-2-Umsetzungs- und Cybersicherheitsstärkungsgesetz) ein Regierungsentwurf zur konkreten Ausprägung auf nationaler Ebene vor.</p>
                          <p>Im Vergleich zur ursprünglichen NIS-Richtlinie erweitert NIS2 den Anwendungsbereich und verpflichtet mehr Unternehmen und Sektoren, strenge Cybersicherheitsmaßnahmen zu implementieren. Unternehmen müssen sich nun auf umfassendere Risikomanagementanforderungen, Meldepflichten bei Sicherheitsvorfällen und Sanktionen bei Nichteinhaltung einstellen. Doch was heißt das konkret für Unternehmen, sicherheitsverantwortliche Stellen und EntwicklerInnen in Unternehmen?</p>
                          <p>Der Vortrag entmystifiziert die wesentlichen Neuerungen der NIS2 und zeigt, welche konkreten Schritte Unternehmen jetzt unternehmen müssen, um Compliance zu erreichen. Dazu gehören unter anderem die Etablierung robuster Cybersicherheitsstrategien, die Anpassung interner Prozesse und die Einführung effektiver Meldeverfahren. Angesichts strengerer Vorgaben und verstärkter Kontrollen wird es für Unternehmen entscheidend, die richtigen Maßnahmen rechtzeitig umzusetzen, um Bußgelder und Reputationsverluste zu vermeiden. Im Rahmen des Vortrages wird insbesondere praxisnah auf den aktuellen Stand des Gesetzgebungsverfahrens und relevante Pflichten für Unternehmen eingegangen.</p>

                          <p>The presentation explores the security challenges and opportunities posed by Generative AI (GenAI). While GenAI offers tremendous potential, it also has a darker side, such as its use in creating deepfakes that can spread misinformation, manipulate political events, or facilitate fraud, as demonstrated in a live deepfake example. Malicious variants of GenAI, are used in phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, and the creation of malware. Additionally, GenAI enables more intelligent network attacks through autonomous botnets decreasing the risk of exposure.</p>
                          <p>Despite these risks, GenAI also provides defensive advantages by enhancing security measures, such as improving threat detection, strengthening access control, and identifying code vulnerabilities. This is exemplified in a live demo showcasing deepfake and AI-based content detection.</p>
                          <p>The presentation also examines the different types of attacks that AI models, including GenAI, are susceptible to, across any task, model, or modality. This includes adversarial attacks, where inputs are specifically crafted to deceive AI systems. Additionally, attacks such as Prompt Injection and Visual Prompt Injection manipulate inputs to mislead models.</p>
                          <p>However, navigating the complex landscape of AI compliance is essential. Organizations must adhere to regulations like the EU AI Act and standards such as ISO 27090, while also following guidelines from bodies like OWASP to ensure the security, transparency, and ethical use of AI systems. The OWASP AI Exchange plays a key role in modeling threats to GenAI, addressing risks and point out solutions. To defend against these threats, various detection and mitigation techniques have been developed and will briefly be presented.</p>

                          <p>Viele Teams stehen vor der Herausforderung, beim Threat Modeling relevante Bedrohungen zu identifizieren, insbesondere wenn nur wenig Security-Expertise vorhanden ist. Die Auswahl und Bewertung von potenziellen Risiken kann für Nicht-Experten schwierig sein. Dieser Lightning Talk zeigt, wie Generative AI (GenAI) hier unterstützen kann, indem sie Bedrohungsszenarien basierend auf bestehenden Daten und Modellen vorschlägt und hilft, erste Entscheidungen zu treffen. Der Vortrag gibt einen kurzen Überblick, wie GenAI als Hilfestellung den Threat-Modeling-Prozess effizienter und zugänglicher machen kann - und welche Einschränkungen es gibt.</p>

                          <p>As organizations increasingly rely on SAP systems to manage critical business processes, the security of these environments is an increasing challenge for companies and has also been recognized by the OWASP Core Business Application Security (CBAS) project. This talk will explore the security of SAP systems from an attacker's perspective, uncovering common vulnerabilities and pitfalls and their respective impact. Drawing from extensive penetration testing experience, this presentation will provide a deep dive into how attackers might exploit SAP vulnerabilities and offer practical guidance on mitigating these threats.</p>
                          <p>We will begin by highlighting prevalent SAP vulnerabilities discovered during real-world pentesting engagements, covering key attack techniques used against SAP systems that exploit misconfigurations, insecure coding practices, and authentication flaws.</p>
                          <p>As an example, we will illustrate the configuration options of SNC, the proprietary protocol for transport layer encryption in SAP environments. Using the open-source tool sncscan, security professionals and administrators alike can assess the encryption and signing settings of SAP systems, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.
                          </p>
                          <p>The session will also provide actionable guidance on mitigating these vulnerabilities, focusing on best practices and tools that can significantly enhance the security posture of SAP systems. By raising awareness of common vulnerabilities and pitfalls we aim to empower security professionals and SAP administrators to better protect their systems against potential exploitation.

                          <p>The need for comprehensive measurements of security and privacy risks on the Web is undeniable as it helps developers in focusing on emerging trends in security. However, large-scale scans for server-side vulnerabilities remains a sensitive topic, due to their potential to harm servers, disrupt services, and incur financial losses. Even smaller, singular tests can be controversial, as demonstrated by incidents like the CSU scandal around Lilith Wittmann in 2021 or the Modern Solution case in 2023. The gray area surrounding the legality, ethics, and industry perspectives on server-side scanning has led to hesitancy among researchers and ethical hackers, creating a critical gap in our understanding of how to conduct such scans responsibly.</p>
                          <p>In this talk, we investigate and interactively discuss the murky boundaries of vulnerability scanning by exploring five typical scanning scenarios that researchers face on the Web. Drawing from We give insights into 23 in-depth interviews we conducted with legal experts, research ethics committee members, and website/server operators to identify what types of scanning practices are acceptable and where the red lines are drawn. We further substantiate these insights with findings from an online survey conducted with 119 server operators.</p>
                          <p>Attendees will gain great insights into the current state of Web scanning, including the lack of judicial clarity and the ethical dilemmas researchers and ethical hackers face. This interactive session also offers a platform for audience members to challenge their own understanding of ethics, share opinions, and contribute to shaping the future of responsible Web security scans.</p>

                          <p>Recent developments in web technologies have seen a paradigm shift from monolithic server-based applications to REST-based microservices with feature-rich browser-based frontends. This progression has brought with it novel classes of security flaws. In this talk we review how client-side variants of injection vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and the recently discovered client-side request hijacking, arise and how traditional defense mechanisms are ineffective. We summarize recent research in this area which shows that such issues are widespread and can have a diverse range of consequences.

                          <p>We go on to show how dynamic taint-tracking has proved to be an effective technique for the discovery of vulnerabilities in client-side JavaScript. The initial overhead in implementing tainting is, however, extremely high, as it typically involves delving into the inner workings of modern web browsers and JavaScript interpreters. We show how Project Foxhound (https://github.com/SAP/project-foxhound/) can help to reduce this burden by providing a flexible, open-source tool which can be fully integrated into browser automation frameworks such as Playwright. Foxhound is gaining traction in the community as the go-to tool for client-side vulnerability studies.

                          <p>We finish the talk by showing how Foxhound can also be used in privacy studies, an update on upcoming features, and how the community use and contribute to the project to help build a safer web!

                          <p>Browser extensions are powerful tools that enhance the web browsing experience, offering their users a wide range of functionalities. However, these features can also introduce security and privacy issues for their users, mainly through a technique known as extension fingerprinting — where malicious websites track users based on the extensions they have installed. This is particularly interesting since many websites rely on advertising-based revenue for their existence, and the cookie-less form of tracking is also increasingly getting traction on the Web. Popular libraries such as FingerprintJS and Castle have already incorporated extensions as identifiable sources in their armor.

                          <p>In this talk, we will present the growing threat of browser extension fingerprinting, shedding light on how extensions can inadvertently expose both users and the extension to certain risks. Our recent research uncovers that over 3,000 Chrome and Firefox extensions are vulnerable to fingerprinting through techniques such as JavaScript namespace pollution and other observable side effects despite existing defense mechanisms [1].
