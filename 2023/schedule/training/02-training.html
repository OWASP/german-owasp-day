    In today's digital world, building secure software is more critical than ever. However, implementing software assurance can be a complex and daunting task, particularly without a good framework. That's where OWASP SAMM comes in - it provides a structural and measurable framework to formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organization.<p>

    <p>This one-day training (in English), consisting of a mix of presentations and interactive workshops, aims to provide participants with a more in-depth understanding and practical experience with the OWASP SAMM model. The training is divided into four parts:<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Part One provides an overview of the model, including the five Business Functions of Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operations, and discusses the various constituent elements, such as metrics. This part also explains the overall usage scenarios of the model.</li>
	<li>Part Two is a hands-on workshop that involves an actual SAMM evaluation of your organization (or one that you have worked for). Participants will go through an evaluation of all the SAMM domains and discuss the results in the group. This part aims to provide participants with a good indication of their organization's maturity in software assurance, and identify the most important challenges in getting to their target model.</li>
	<li>Part Three covers the OWASP SAMM tools, including the Assessment Toolkit, Benchmark Project, and relationships with other SAMM projects and tools.</li>
	<li>Part Four concludes the training by discussing OWASP SAMM best practices, including choosing the right starting points, monitoring and metrics, achieving security by default, and critical success factors.</li>
  </ul>
If you haven't started a secure software initiative in your organization yet, this training will provide you with the necessary foundations and ideas to do so. The training concludes with a group discussion, where participants can share experiences and address specific questions or challenges they are facing regarding secure development in their organizations.
    </p>
	<p>Rest assured that confidentiality is a priority in this training, and we adhere to the Chatham House Rule.<br/>
This training will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to implement software assurance in your organization successfully.
