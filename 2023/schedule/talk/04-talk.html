Organizations that prioritize cybersecurity often have cybersecurity culture for breakfast. Literally. Culture starts from the management to the developer to the product owner. One way of revolutionizing the organization’s culture is through building security champions. A security champion is a member of a development team that are tasked with security issues and acts as the primary contact. This talk will focus on seven principles of success while building security champions, for example, human centered approaches and empowerment. The talk will also give ideas on activities you can do to motivate your security champions.
