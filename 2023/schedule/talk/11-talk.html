    <p>Security and privacy are still often viewed as orthogonal issues. That is, techniques to ensure that applications are immune against common vulnerabilities are evaluated from a pure security perspective. Conversely, the same is true for privacy enhancing technologies. We believe, this is a mistake! Using taint-tracking as an example, this talk will show significant parallels between the root causes of privacy and security problems.</p>

<p>Taint-tracking is well established to prevent injection vulnerabilities (i.e., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL and command injection) in web applications. The root cause of injection vulnerabilities are unfiltered data flows of user-controlled data.</p>

<p>The adoption of technologies that provide proactive security guarantees is often hindered by the non-negligible runtime overhead. However, considering security benefits in isolation however misses potential privacy synergies. Purpose binding, a core aspect of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can be seen as a data-flow related issue, just like injection vulnerabilities. Taking these aspects into account, enforcement tools can be built that not only prevent common vulnerability classes, but also prevent privacy leaks due to faulty program logic.</p>
