<p>What happens when a cyber attacker that wants to gain illicit access to an account or application decides not to bother with brute force attacks but opts for manipulating a user into handing over those credentials instead?</p>
<p>For years we have been reading reports warning us that people are the primary attack vector. Social engineering attacks remain at the top of the threat landscape and data breach reports. But although we tend to simplify many breaches as the result of a successful phishing attack, the reality we get from current threat research is more complex. Social engineering attacks have been evolving. Today, the pathway that leads to that successful phishing email is often the result of a larger,
well-researched attack kill chain. But it doesn't stop there, and it does not get easier from here onwards.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity today is not only a technical challenge.
It is also a behavioral challenge. As long as users can provide access to systems and data, they remain a crucial component to the security of any system.</p>
<p>This talk provides insights into the mechanisms and the methodology of today's social engineering attacks and current threat landscape. It discusses the trends we have been observing in social engineering and the tricks attackers use to build trust and elicit information that assists them in initiating, or delivering a cyberattack, while bypassing a multitude of technical security measures.</p>
<p>Last, the presentation discusses where we, as a cybersecurity industry miss the mark, and what we can do to ensure that the people in our organizations are on board with the security measures we apply and encourage them to take.</p>

    <i>Christina Lekati is a psychologist and a social engineer. With her background and degree in psychology, she learned the mechanisms of behavior, motivation, decision making, as well as manipulation and deceit. She became particularly interested in human dynamics and passionate about social engineering.
        <br><br>
Contrary to typical career paths, her history and involvement in the cybersecurity field started quite early in her life. Being raised by George Lekatis, a sought-after cyber security expert, she found herself magnetized by the security field at a very young age. Growing up, she was able to get involved in different projects that were often beyond her age, that gave her an edge in her own knowledge and experience.
<br><br>
Christina has participated among other things in penetration tests, in training to companies and organizations, and in needs and vulnerability assessments.
<br><br>
She is working with Cyber Risk GmbH as a social engineering expert and trainer. Christina is the main developer of the social engineering training programs provided by Cyber Risk GmbH. Those programs are intertwining the lessons learned from real life cases and previous experiences with the fields of cybersecurity, psychology and counterintelligence. They often cover unique aspects while their main goal is to inspire delegates with a sense of responsibility and a better relationship with security.
